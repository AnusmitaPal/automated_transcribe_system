 Automated Transcription System Using Whisper Model 

 Key Functional Requirements: 
1.Recursive File Scanning: 
The application should scan a given directory and all its subdirectories for audio and video files. 
It should support common formats such as MP3, WAV, MP4, MKV, MOV, FLV, AAC, and M4A. 

2.Automatic Transcription Process: 
Once a file is detected, the application should transcribe its content using the Whisper model. 
The generated transcription should be saved as a text file in the same folder as the input media file. 

3.Real-Time File Monitoring: 
The system should continuously monitor the assigned folder and subfolders. 
When a new file is added, the transcription should trigger automatically without manual intervention. 


The goal of this project is to develop an automated transcription system that utilizes OpenAIâ€™s Whisper model to transcribe video and audio files. The system should efficiently process files in a designated directory and its subdirectories while supporting real-time monitoring for newly added media files.
